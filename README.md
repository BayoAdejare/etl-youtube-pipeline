# YouTube Data ETL Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that automates data processing from multiple sources, including YouTube, using Apache Airflow. The pipeline integrates data from various sources, performs transformations, and loads the processed data into a data warehouse while implementing robust data quality checks.

## Features

- Automated ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow
- Integration with YouTube Data API for video statistics
- Additional data source integrations (e.g., weather data, social media metrics)
- Data quality checks and error handling
- Scalable architecture for processing large volumes of data
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Apache Airflow 2.0+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Google Cloud Platform account (for YouTube Data API)
- (Add other necessary accounts or API keys)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-etl-pipeline.git
   cd youtube-etl-pipeline
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your API keys and configuration details.

5. Initialize the Airflow database:
   ```
   airflow db init
   ```

6. Start Airflow services:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Usage

1. Access the Airflow web interface at `http://localhost:8080`.

2. Enable and trigger the `youtube_etl_dag` to start the ETL process.

3. Monitor the DAG runs and task statuses in the Airflow UI.

4. Check the `data/processed/` directory for the output of the ETL pipeline.

## Data Sources

1. YouTube Data API: Video statistics, channel information, and comments.
2. (Add other data sources as applicable)

## Data Quality Checks

The pipeline includes several data quality checks:

- Null value detection
- Data type validation
- Uniqueness constraints
- Range checks for numeric fields
- Consistency checks across related data

## Monitoring and Logging

- Airflow provides built-in logging and monitoring capabilities.
Custom logging is implemented for detailed tracking of the ETL process.
Alerts are configured for failed tasks and data quality issues.

## Scaling
This pipeline is designed to scale horizontally. To handle larger volumes of data:

Increase the number of worker nodes in your Airflow cluster.
Optimize database connections and implement connection pooling.
Consider using a distributed processing framework like Apache Spark for heavy transformations.
